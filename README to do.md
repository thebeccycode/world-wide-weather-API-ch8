# world-wide-weather-API-ch8

##Description
The aim of this project was to create a website that pulls data from OpenWeather API using a mixture of JavaScript and jQuery. 

This was challenging as my knowledge of both JavaScript and jQuery is still a work in progress but in doing this, I have learnt a lot about fetch and ajax, using local storage and appending data to the html via JavaScript/jQuery.

I am submitting this before it is complete with the intentions of returning to it once I have recieved the help I need to finish it.

##Usage and Application
Once this is working, a user can input a city into the search box and the current weather plus a 5-day forecast will be presented on the appropriate fields on the webpage.
